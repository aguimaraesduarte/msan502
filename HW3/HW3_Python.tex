\section*{Python problem}
In this problem, we will use \texttt{pandas} and \texttt{numpy} to find the best fit line in the sense of least squares to a set of data consisting of paired observations in the form $(x; y)$. The code for my implementation can be found in files \texttt{TVlife.py}, \texttt{population.py}, and \texttt{nba.py}. In addition, I found a data set online concerning XXX that I analyzed using the same system as these files. Here, I will explain how I proceeded, and show the results and graphs.

\subsection*{population.txt}
This file contains information concerning the national population ($y$) as a function of the year ($x$). Plotting $y$ against $x$, we get the graph seen in figure \ref{pop_plain}. We can see that a linear regression seems to be a likely candidate for regression.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{pop_plain.png}
\caption{National US population from 1900 to 2000}
\label{pop_plain}
\end{figure}

With \texttt{numpy}, we can easily obtain $\widehat{\textbf{x}}$ that minimizes the error. We just need to compute:

$\widehat{\textbf{x}} = (A^TA)^{-1}A^T\textbf{b}$.

We get $\widehat{\textbf{x}} = \left[\begin{smallmatrix}-3.741 \cdot 10^9\\2.003 \cdot 10^6\end{smallmatrix}\right]$.

If we draw this line on top of the data, we get the image in figure \ref{pop_reg}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{pop_reg.png}
\caption{National US population from 1900 to 2000 and regression line}
\label{pop_reg}
\end{figure}

The fit that we computed seems to be what we would expect.

The error $\textbf{e}$ is found with the equation $\textbf{e} = \textbf{b} - A\widehat{\textbf{x}}$. In this case, we get $||\textbf{e}||^2 = 7.268 \cdot 10^7$.

\newpage
\subsection*{nba.txt}
This file contains information concerning team winning percentage in basketball games ($y$) as a function of PM (the average point difference over all that team's games) ($x$). Plotting $y$ against $x$, we get the graph seen in figure \ref{nba_plain}. We can see that a linear regression seems to be a likely candidate for regression.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{nba_plain.png}
\caption{Team winning percentage as a function of PM}
\label{nba_plain}
\end{figure}

With \texttt{numpy}, we can easily obtain $\widehat{\textbf{x}}$ that minimizes the error. We just need to compute:

$\widehat{\textbf{x}} = (A^TA)^{-1}A^T\textbf{b}$.

We get $\widehat{\textbf{x}} = \left[\begin{smallmatrix}0.500\\0.032\end{smallmatrix}\right]$.

If we draw this line on top of the data, we get the image in figure \ref{nba_reg}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{nba_reg.png}
\caption{Team winning percentage as a function of PM and regression line}
\label{nba_reg}
\end{figure}

The fit that we computed seems to be what we would expect.

The error $\textbf{e}$ is found with the equation $\textbf{e} = \textbf{b} - A\widehat{\textbf{x}}$. In this case, we get $||\textbf{e}||^2 = 0.215$.

\newpage
\subsection*{TVlife.txt}
This file contains information concerning life expectancy ($y$) as a function of televisions per thousand people ($x$). Plotting $y$ against $x$, we get the graph seen in figure \ref{TV_plain}. In this case, linear regression does not seem like the best candidate for regression. Maybe a polynomial regression would work better in this case. But we will proceed with linear regression for this problem.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{TV_plain.png}
\caption{Life expectancy per televisions per thousand people}
\label{TV_plain}
\end{figure}

With \texttt{numpy}, we can easily obtain $\widehat{\textbf{x}}$ that minimizes the error. We just need to compute:

$\widehat{\textbf{x}} = (A^TA)^{-1}A^T\textbf{b}$.

We get $\widehat{\textbf{x}} = \left[\begin{smallmatrix}57.337\\0.032\end{smallmatrix}\right]$.

If we draw this line on top of the data, we get the image in figure \ref{TV_reg}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{TV_reg.png}
\caption{Life expectancy per televisions per thousand people and regression line}
\label{TV_reg}
\end{figure}

The linear fit seems adequate, but a polynomial regression would produce a better result in this particular case.

The error $\textbf{e}$ is found with the equation $\textbf{e} = \textbf{b} - A\widehat{\textbf{x}}$. In this case, we get $||\textbf{e}||^2 = 37.655$.

\newpage
\subsection*{30oysters.txt}
I got this file from the \textit{Journal of Statistics Education}, via the website \url{http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/jse_data_archive.htm}. The file consists of 30 observations of 5 variables concerning oysters that was collected in 2001. The direct link to the file is: \url{http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/datasets/30oysters.dat.txt}.

This file contains information concerning 30 oysters' volume in cc ($y$) as a function of their weight in grams ($x$). Plotting $y$ against $x$, we get the graph seen in figure \ref{30oysters_plain}. We can see that a linear regression seems to be a likely candidate for regression. The data seems very linearly correlated.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{30oysters_plain.png}
\caption{Oysters' volume as a function of their weight}
\label{30oysters_plain}
\end{figure}

With \texttt{numpy}, we can easily obtain $\widehat{\textbf{x}}$ that minimizes the error. We just need to compute:

$\widehat{\textbf{x}} = (A^TA)^{-1}A^T\textbf{b}$.

We get $\widehat{\textbf{x}} = \left[\begin{smallmatrix}0.714\\0.955\end{smallmatrix}\right]$.

If we draw this line on top of the data, we get the image in figure \ref{30oysters_reg}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{30oysters_reg.png}
\caption{Oyster's volume as a function of their weight and regression line}
\label{30oysters_reg}
\end{figure}

The fit that we computed seems to be what we would expect.

The error $\textbf{e}$ is found with the equation $\textbf{e} = \textbf{b} - A\widehat{\textbf{x}}$. In this case, we get $||\textbf{e}||^2 = 0.758$.
